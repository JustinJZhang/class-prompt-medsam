# class-prompt-medsam

🚀: We address the challenges of medical image segmentation across diverse imaging modalities using limited computational resources. We incorporate a class-prompt mechanism into a lightweight TinyVIT architecture, enabling efficient and accurate segmentation tailored to specific modalities. 

⭐️: We are also working on a updated version, stay tuned!
